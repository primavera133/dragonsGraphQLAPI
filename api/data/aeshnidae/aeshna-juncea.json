Serrata whose stem is less distinct.\n\nEyes have a yellow spot on the backside, which distinguishes it from A. subarctica. \nVariations occur with very small or indistinguishable spots.\n\nThe male especially, is rather dark, compared to A. cyanea, \nbut often more vivid in colours compared to A. subarctica.\n\nFemales have two colour forms, one dark body with blue and greyish markings \n(a lot like the males) or with green spots on the sides of the abdomen and yellow spots on top.","behaviour":"A large and powerfull flyer, and both sexes can be active even in bad weather. \n\nMales patrol low over to water, searching along edges for females.\nAbdomens tend to hang slightly in flight, while A. juncea has a straighter posture.\n\nBoth sexes hunt high up in treetops and is often seen far from waters, \nand sometimes late in evenings.\nInsect-rich places like open sunlit, clearings, forest roads and forest edges are good places to look for this specie.","size":{"length":"70-80 mm","wingspan":"90-105 mm"},"similar_species":["Aeshna serrata","Aeshna subarctica","Aeshna crenata","Aeshna cyanea","Aeshna mixta","Aeshna caerula"],"distribution":"A. juncea is widespread in Europe and all over the northern hemisphere, present also in Asia as well as North America.\nIn Europe it is common in the north, becomming scarcer and confined to higher altitudes in the south. \nIt is fairly common in the Alps and the Pyrenees, but it is scarce and known only from scattered \nhigh altitude locales in south-east Europe and the Iberian Peninsula.","habitat":"It is mostly confined to nutrient-poor, standing and unshaded waters, having a preference for bogs and other standing \nwaters with well-developed Sphagnum vegetation.\nAt lower altitudes in central and western Europe the largest populations are found in larger bogs with peat moss and sedges or rushes.\nWith lesser dense populations it can be found in quarries, dune ponds, fens or peaty areas with fields of water soldier.\n\nIn Fennoscandia and mountain areas it uses a wider range of waters, and can be found in slow-flowing water, \nlakes or ponds with sparse vegetation.","flight_period":"June to October","red_list":{"habitats_directive":"No","red_list_EU27":"Least Concern","red_list_europe":"Least Concern","red_list_mediterranean":"Least Concern","EU27_endemic":"No","red_list_europe_endemic":"No","trend_europe":"Stable"}}
