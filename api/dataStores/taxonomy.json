The thorax is yellow-brown with blue hues in mature males, and has only fine black lines along the sutures on the sides. Antehumeral stripes are short and narrow, in contrast with other species of the family Aeshnidae like A. cyanea and A. viridis. The abdomen is characterised by large light-blue spots, brighter and more extensive than on A. mixta. The second abdominal segment, S2, is all blue except for a distinctive black mask-like pattern. The pterostigma is relatively long, longer than on A. mixta. The leading wing margin, the costa, has a light colour.\n\nFemales can be very similar to males. Generally a more lightly yellow jizz compared to other Aeshna females can be noted. Lighter and paler than A. mixta but can resemble Brachytron pratense in size and colour. Also, the rather uni-coloured sides of the abdomen of females make them similar to females of A. viridis. They can be distinguished from those of A. mixta by the relatively short abdominal appendages, shorter than S9-10 combined.",

The male usually incessantly patrols its territory, flying low at about chest height, often beating to and fro over a small area. It frequently perches and alights on tall grass and bushes. IT's not easily disturbed. It is the only species of Aeshna in which the male stays attached to the female after mating, laying eggs in tandem.",

                            "habitat": "The species reproduces exclusively in standing waters, preferring shallow well-vegetated waters sheltered from the wind and exposed to the sun. Many habitats dry up partially or fully during the summer and have patches of mud often bordered by loose to dense vegetation of rushes, sedges, Black bogrush or low reeds. A wide selection of water types can support habitats for A. affinis, incuding marshes temporarily flooded depressions in agricultural landscapes, old oxbows, small (dune) lakes and ponds or shallow edges of larger lakes with helophytes belts. Despite of the broad array of habitats, suitable habitats are generally scarce. Many of the habitats where A. affinis occurs become unsuitable after several decades or even a few years due to natural succession of vegetation, for example, following inundation of floodplains. In other situations, management such as grazing or mowing is needed to maintain suitable habitat. In contrast with other species with a strong preference for warm climatic conditions, it is rarely found in quarries or gravel pits. In Italy it is also found in rice fields, but it has decreased in this habitat. \n\nAeshna Affinis is mainly found in lowlands and in central Europe it is seldom found above 700 m.",

The eyes meet only just, the adjacent area is diagnostically narrow at the top of the head. This can easily be seen with binoculars when it perches.\n\nThe males have azure blue, rather large spots on each abdominal segment. The lateral bands on the thorax are pale, light blue or yellow-white, narrow and wavy. Antehumeral stripes are reduced in males. Pterostigma color is varying from brown to orange. The leading margin of the wing is yellow-brown. Males have a white frons. Unique to this species is that the blue of the male pales to a more grey colour at lower temperatures.\n\nThe female color varies a lot but can be grouped into two forms; one is generally similar to the males but everything blue is more grey-blue, its abdominal spots are also smaller. The other form lacks all blue color and is generally brown with yellow or beige abdominal spots.\nBoth forms have characteristic triangular black markings on the last abdominal segments.\nAntehumeral stripes are mostly absent in females, but sometimes vague remains can be seen.\nEspecially in the northern regions females have smoky dark wings.\n\nTenerals of both sexes are brownish with light to white abdominal spots.",
                            "behaviour": "On hot sunny days males are very active, flying low and wide in search of females. Unlike A. juncea, males will also perch, basking on stones on the ground or light tree trunks. This behaviour warms its body and enables it to survive in colder regions. \n\nIt shelters in heather or similar low vegetation in dull weather. When hunting on a sunny day it can fly high above the trees in search for prey. Above the arctic circle, under the midnight sun, it can hunt almost 24 hours a day. It is active even during cloudy weather and can be seen flying even in lighter rain. In those conditions it flies low, in and among vegetation, scaring up  insects.\n\nEggs are oviposited in small open water bodies, in sphagnum moss or other soft material. Larvae development takes two to four years, most often three years. Larvae live in shallow water, but often deeply burrowed in bottom material and can be hard to find. Exuvia are found low on upright straws or such, in or near water.",

It seems in warmer conditions it is out-competed by other large dragonflies, like A. juncea. In colder areas, its habitat range is broader, probably due to reduced pressure from other species. In the north of Europe it is predominantly found in lowlands, with a maximum breeding habitat altitude of around 550 m in Scotland.\n\nThe species is present in standing and sometimes slow-flowing water, namely in fens and bog ponds and depressions, palsa mires and sedge swamps in moors,  heaths and tundra depressions. Above the tree line, it's mostly found in peaty ponds. \n\nIn its central European range, almost all records are from 1 000 m to 2 600 m with the main breeding habitats between 1 400 m and 2 200 m. Here it's found in bogs and permanent peaty water with a surface ranging from 5 to 80 m2 and water depth of generally 20 cm or less. The vegetation consists of peat moss (Sphagnums), sedges, and cottongrass. The water is frozen for large parts of the year but the water temperature can rise quickly during the day in spring and summer, exceeding 20 C.",

The wings are evenly tinted with a bronze shade, which is visible in flight. Mature males have blue spots beside the base of each wing, on S2 and the side of the abdomen. They also get a blue hue in their eyes. Females have blue spots only beside the base of the wings, the other spots are yellow. In immature individuals, all spots are yellow. A. grandis has none or indistinct antehumeral stripes. The thorax sides has two broad lemmon-yellow bands, with no spots in between.",
                            "behaviour": "Flight is powerful, fast and untiring. Males patrol large areas. Males might seem less aggressive than other aeshnids but that might be due to territorial size rather than any male backing down on a fight. It will still engage on any other male they meet. It can be found in numbers, ten or more, far from waters, hunting high up in the air in glades, on forest road openings or over tree-tops. On warm summer evenings it can be active quite late in the evenings.",

In the French Pyrenees and south-east Europe populations are small and isolated. In the west and south it prefers forested areas and might be lacking in open landscapes, like central Hungary. In central Europe it is common, but population levels are usually low compared to other more abundant aeshnids.\nFar higher densities are found in mountainous areas and in the north and north-east, where it can be omnipresent.",

In the south of its European range, the species is absent from habitats in the early stages of succession, apparently requiring more mature habitats. Most of the population in central and northern Europe are found in lowlands up to 500  m in altitude, but in the west and the south of its range long-lasting populations are confined to higher altitudes, although in the Alps most populations are found below 1 000 m. Nevertheless, it's frequently found up to 2 00 m in Austria and the French Pyrenees and reproduction has been recorded up to 2 250 m.",

This could be explained by a preference for warmer areas combined with a habitat preference for extensive reed marshes or well-developed beds of submerged aquatic vegetation.  Due to this it is absent from the highest mountain regions and most of northern Europe, while it is rare in the Iberian Peninsula and parts of France due to a lack of extensive reed marshes.",

Wings are clear with long pterostigmas and yellow leading margin. On older individuals though, especially females, the wings can take on a light brown tone. Thorax is brown with narrow antehumeral stripes. Thorax sides have two broad bands, coloured blue, green or yellow. Between the band are 1-3 smaller spots. The shape of these spots can be used in separating from similar species, but they can be hard to see due to wear and age. Frons is yellow with a black T-shaped marking. This marking distinguishes it from simillar specie A. Serrata whose stem is less distinct. Eyes have a yellow spot on the backside, which distinguishes it from A. subarctica. Variations occur with very small or indistinguishable spots. The male especially, is rather dark, compared to A. cyanea, but often more vivid in colours compared to A. subarctica.

The spot behind the eyes that A. juncea has is always absent on A. subarctica. On S3 on the abdomen, the male has rather big, wide spots, unlike A. juncea who has narrow wedge-shaped spots here. Upper and lower appendages are wider and rounder than on A. juncea. Ventrally on thorax it has two large yellow spots, where A. juncea has smaller or missing spots. There are two forms of A. subarctica in Europe. The northern can be found from north of Scania, Sweden, and northwards.  It has three lesser spots between the bands on the sides of the thorax. The southern form occurs on the European mainland, in Denmark and southern Scania. It has larger spots or a narrow band where the northern form has three lesser spots.

The key factor determining habitat suitability is the vegetation which need to be a rather dense growth of helophytes in shallow water of generally up to half a meter deep. In order to provide both shelter and space to move, the vegetation should neither be too low nor too high during the flight period. Suitable conditions can be found in natural and semi-natural habitats such as reed beds and peat excavations in ferns and wet meadows. In the later types of habitats, the species is dependent on mowing and the cyclical creation of new peat excavations, as otherwise its preferred habitats disappear due to the natural regrowth of vegetation.",

This has historically led to the desription of various subspecies, none of which presently is regarded as valid.

Some records also suggest the species occur in the southern Urals, and since the regions are largely under-explored for Odonata, C. glaciale could be more widespread than currently known.",
                            "habitat": "The species favours small meso- and oligotrophic cold-water bodies, especially small lakes girdled with sedges, Sphagnum and other mosses and situated in forest landscapes. In Europe, it has been found in the Taiga zone at three small lakes surrounded by spruce and pine forests. The area where the species has been found is karstic, of high habitat diversity, with a greater frequency of non-acidic, mineral-rich wetlands than in most other parts of the Taiga zone. These characteristics, together with the severe local climatic conditions might have contributed to its presence in this area. Three characteristics have been identified; 1. Surrounding forests providing shelter from winds.  2. Low water temperature, deeply frzen for long periods and/or fed by a cold inflow. 3. Diversified vegetation, especially sedges and other low-growing species.",

In the west of its range and in the mountains of the south and south-east Europe, the species is largely limited to peat bogs and oligotrophic to mesotrophic lakes and ponds often in or near forests and nearly always with a well-developed belt of sedges. It is rarely found in agricultural landscapes.\n\nIn the north the species is mostly found in the lowlands but, in the south populations is often confined to higher elevations up to 2 500 m.

The core of its range includes the Netherlands, northern Germany, Poland, the south of both Sweden and Finland, and the Baltic states, from where it is expected to continue east to the Ural Mountains. The species is rare south and north of this core region and is mostly found in scattered, small populations from the Ukrainian Carpathians to the Czech Republic and the Alps, and throughout most of Fennoscandia. In contrast to its rarity in the Alps, it is well established in Massif Central in France, which constitutes a disjunct area of occurence. Another disjunct area is found in Ireland, where C. lunulatum is widespread but uncommon in the northern half of the island. It is remarkably absent from Great Britain.",

These often support a vegetation of small sedges and Sphagnum peat mosses, and are largely unshaded. Most habitats lie within or in direct proximity to forests. In the east of its range, the species is found in a wider range of habitats such as cattle ponds and gravel and clay pits, where it occurs regularly in slightly more eutrophic water bodies with rather ordinary fringing vegetation. C. lunulatum is mainly found in lowlands and low hills in the north of its range, and is confined to mountains up to 1 500 m in the south. It is very rare in the Alps, which correlates with its rarity in the boreal belt.",

The vegetation near the banks often consists of low herbs and grasses and is frequently used for hay production or grazing.

Natural habitat types where these conditions occur are spring marshes, karstic springs and streams. Most of the European populations are presently found in agricultural areas, at small ditches and streams. Many of these habitats depend on both the cyclic cleaning of water courses and the mowing of bank side vegetation to prevent the habitat from becoming overgrown. In Slovenia it was noted that the species readily colonises newly created ditches and streams. In most Europe the species favours largely open habitats below 600 m. In the Balkan Peninsula populations have been found up to 900 m, while in Turkey it occurs in mountain streams up to 1 800 m, some of which are extensively snow-covered in winter.",

Northwards, the species has increased its range with nearly 200 km from the 1990s onwards. This expansion has been noted in Belgium, the Netherlands and northern Germany ad was most likely caused by increasing temperatures during recent decades.

Breeding habitats are generally large, largely unshaded with clear oxygenated water. The species is less common on fast-flowing waters, and in streams and rivers with a strong current it is often confined to areas where the flow is the weakest. In most cases there is a rich submerged aquatic vegetation with helophyte belts poorly developed or even absent. In fish-free waters, the presence of aquatic vegetation is of less importance, suggesting that the latter is mainly important in providing shelter against predation. Standing waters where the species occurs are often influenced by wind, which generates waves, or are fed by seepage, both which help to oxygenate the water and break down stratification. This produces conditions resembling to those found in running waters. Throughout its range, the species is confined to lower altitudes and most of the records are from below 500 m.",

The easternmost records are found in the Carpathians in the west of Ukraine and in the east of Romania and Bulgaria. Its specialised habitat means that it is much more localised than C. boltonii, and in large areas of central and western Europe only scattered populations occur, although closely aggregated sites are found in tufa regions. Population densities vary strongly between regions and sites, but are generally low. The highest densities occur mainly in the western Carpathians and the Balkan Peninsula, as well as some tufa regions in France. The habitat is sometimes difficult to recognise or to access, particularly in mountainous regions, and, as the species often occur in low numbers, populations are easily overlooked and in the past the species was erroneously thought to have become extinct in countries such as Switzerland.",

It occurs up to 1 400 m in the Alps and the Pyrenees. The larvae are mostly limited to seepage and spring waters, runnels and the upper courses of streams, although older larvae sometimes drift to the lower parts of the stream. They do not cope well with strong currents. Adults breed mainly in short, often remote stretches of headwater areas, with the most suitable habitats being sandy or muddy springs, tufa springs and small calcareous streams. Populations can even regularly be found in places where water is trickling from a rocky slope with almost no visible open water. Suitable waters are often calcareous, but this could be a correlate with the preferred habitat type, which is more common in calcareous areas. The species is regionally absent in areas where acidic streams result from acidic rain, but in other areas can still be recorded in streams with a pH below 4.",

Its northern limit is found from the south-easternmost part of the Czech Republic to souther Slovakia and northern Romania. To the south, the species reaches the north of the Peloponnese in Greece, and to the west the north-east of Italy, close to the Slovene border. To the East it is widely distributed in Bulgaria but is replaced by C. picta in the south-east of this country, the north-east of Greece and the European part of Turkey. Cordulegaster heros is regionally common in the eat of Austria, Slovenia, southern Slovakia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia, Macedonia, mainland Greece, Bulgaria, and south-western Romania.

The thin yellow line between the two wide bands on the side of the thorax has a straight rear margin. This is bent in C. heros. The upper appendages are thinner and more divergent in comparison to those of C. heros. The occipital triangle is not completely black in C. picta, instead it has two small yellow spots. The anal loop in the hind wing is made up of 5 cells. In Greece and south-eastern Europe the identification of the various species of Cordulegaster can only be made with certainty by examining the male terminal appendages.

The abdomen can appear to look striped in flight, but has no striped markings (an effect of the metallic shine). It has yellow or whitish markings on the underside, especially near the base, but none on the upper side. In flight the abdomen is held slightly higher than the horizontal plane. The males can dip the last segments in flight. Male abdomen is clearly clubbed, widest at segments S7-8. Female abdomens are cigarr-shaped, S2 somewhat widened. Frons is completely dark green, without yellow markings.\n\nThe only green metallic species to fly early in spring. Closest resemblances are from Somatochlora metallica and S. flavimacculata, but these emerge later. It can also be separated from these by having all dark frons, lacking yellow spots and males having a clubbed abdomen, clearly thickest at S7-8, where Somatochloras often is more evenly thickened over several segments. Oxygastra curtisii also has an all dark frons, but its abdomen has a dorsal chain of yellow spots. The female abdomen can make it look like Somatochlora alpestris or S. sahlbergi but these are all darker, less metallic and lack any yellow colouration on the wing bases.",

The restricted distribution in these two latter regions coincide with the scarcity of woodlands with which C. aenea seems to have a close association. The southernmost regular occurrences in western Europe are in the Pyrenees, the southern Alps and northern Italy., with a few isolated records in central and southern Italy. The species extends further south in the Balkan Peninsula, reaching the hills and mountains of northern Greece with a few isolated records known from the Peloponnese.  The seemingly scattered distribution of the species in Belarus, Ukraine and most of Russia is most likely due to insufficient field investigations. Populations from the Pontic Alps in northern Turkey extend further eastwards up to the Caucasus, but the species seem to be rare and isolated in the lowlands of southern European Russia.",

They fly fast and close to the water surface, interrupted by bouts of hovering. Territories are small and dense, one male quickly takes over a good spot as soon as another leaves it in chase of a female or when scaring off other males. Both mature and immature individuals can be found on land close to nearby waters, in glades, sunlit tree lines and among sparse shrubberies. They like to perch at least a meter up, not so much directly on the ground. Eggs are oviposited in floating or standing vegetation in the water. The larvae live in the decaying bottom substrates for 2-3 years. The exuvia are left close to the water on reed straws or similar.",

The species is mostly found at woodland lakes, oxbow ponds, fish ponds, peat bogs, fenlands and heath ponds and in older gravel pits.

With regards to its appearance it is similar to Libellula quadrimaculata and L. fulva from which it can be distinguished by the wings being entirely yellowish with a large patch at the base of the hind wings and by the different extension of the pattern on the abdomen., besides the shape of the abdomen itself. In the males the abdomen is more tapered than in the females, its dark pattern is dorsally wider and longer, and the terminal appendages are divergent to form a V, whereas in the females they are parallell.

Mature adults are difficult to detect, so the species is frequently overlooked, and in some regions it might be more common than currently believed. The species becomes more common to the east and is probably more widely distributed in European Russia than suggested by available records. Only old records are known from Italy, the Netherlands, Bosnia and Herzegovina, but E. bimaculata has always been rare in these countries. Several new localities for Serbia has been found since the turn of the millenium and a sight record from Lake Skadar in Montenegro has been published, suggesting that the species might be more widely distributed in the states of former Yugoslavia than previously known. Adults are generally difficult to find as they spend much time away from water and, when at their breeding habitat, tend to fly over the water surface away from the bank. Searching for exuviae is therefore the best method to find the species, and further surveys might show it to be more widely distributed than currently known. ",

The species occurs mostly in lowlands although it has been found up to 1 000 m in Switzerland. Many habitats have a mosaic of open water and areas of abundant submerged and floating vegetation such as waterlilies, watermilfoil and pondweeds, but there are also localities with little to no aquatic vegetation. Most localities are at leat partially surrounded by trees or bushes. Banks can be open or densely vegetated with helophytes, for instance reeds, bulrush and sedges. Population densities vary strongly between sites and between years, with counts of exuviae in France ranging from single records to more than 5 000 at seemingly similar sites.",

It can be distinguished by a white, not yellow, ring between S2 and S3 and by the presence of two cubito-anal cross-veins in the fore wings, where similar species has only one. On the males, the appendages are distinctive, convergent and doubly angled. The vulvular lamina of the females is large, reaching halfway along S9, triangular in shape and projecting at a right angle to the abdomen's axis. Frons is black with small yellow spots on each side. These are the only yellow markings on the body. The contrast between the eye and body colour is greater than on S. metallica or C. aenea. Pterostigma are dark or orange, where S. sahlbergi has lighter colouration.",
                            "distribution": "Somatochlora alpestris is, together with Aeshna caerulea, one of the best examples of a dragonfly with a boreo-alpine distribution. It is widely distributed in Fennoscandia and (probably) the north European Russia, and is reasonably common throughout the higher parts of the central European mountains. In Fennoscandia it occurs from sea level in the north to more mountainous areas in the south. In central Europe, it is confined to to mountain ranges from 800 m (rarely as low as 600m) to ca 2 500 m. It is widespread and generally common in the Alps but is less frequent in other mountain ranges. Other inhabited mountain ranges include, the Vosges in France, the Fichtelgebirge, Erzegebirge, Thuringian forest, Harz and Black Forest in Germany, the Tatra and the Carpathian Mountains in the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Ukraine and Romania. Recent studies has shown the species to be more common in the Carpathian range than previously thought.",

                            "behaviour": "Somatochlora alpestris is hunting in sunlit glades of mountain birch forests, along forest roads and other sun exposed areas in woodland or over mires. It perches mostly in trees or shrubberies and is rarely seen directly on the ground. Most commonly you only find single individuals but larger numbers of individuals can be seen when foraging or when they just have left the water. Males patrol slowly and low, flying back and forth within a rather restricted territories. It can make aggressive outbursts against other species if they enter the territory. Larvae live in shallow water or within wet Sphagnum moss. Exuviae are left high up on straws out in the water or along the shores.",
                            "habitat": "Somatochlora alpestris favours flooded depressions in peat bogs, small peaty ponds and man-made peat diggings in Sphagnum bogs and transitional mires. More seldom, it is found in larger acidic peaty waters in open alpine meadows, semi-wooded areas or coniferous forests. The species is confined to cold arctic and mountain climates. The larvae are well adapted to these conditions, as they are tolerant to freezing in winter and desiccation of the peat layers in which they live in the summer. Conversely the adults show a great sensitivity to summer weather conditions, being decimated by summer snowfalls lasting longer than three or four days.",

More slender than S. alpestris, with which it often co-occurs. The male waist (S3) is narrower and it lacks the white conspicuous ring of S. alpestris. Instead the males have a thin yellow ring, often broken. It is most like S. flavimaculata in abdominal slenderness but lacks yellow spots along the sides of the abdomen. Females have two large yellow spots at the side of the base of the abdomen, like the females of S. metallica and S. flavimaculata, but unlike S. alpestris and A. Sahlbergi who does not sport these spots.\n\nEyes are bright-green and greatly contrasts the dark body. Female and immature male eyes can sometimes be brown. S. arctica as well as S. alpestris and A. sahlbergi has a grey spot on the side of the eye. Frons is black with small yellow spots on each side. Wings are hyalene but can have a slight yellow tint, especially close to the wing base. It has only one cubito-anal crossvein in the hind wing, where S. alpestris has two. The male upper terminal appendages are distinctive, in the shape of callipers, rather like an earwig. The females have a slightly protruding vulvar lamina. ",
                            "distribution": "Somatochlora arctica is mainly found in Fennoskandia and in west to central European mountains and foothills. Contrary to S. alpestris it is not confined to high elevations in central Europe and occurs in the central and northern lowlands, and is found in both Scotland and Ireland. In the latter country, it is remarkably rare considering the amount of habitat available and its relatively wide distribution in Scotland. It is widespread in the Alps, the French massif Central and the Vosges mountains and foothills. Further south, it is rare and local in the eastern parts of the Pyrenees and in the mountains of Romania and Bulgaria. The low number of records from Belarus and the north of Ukraine is at least partly the result of low recording intensity in these areas. Somatochlora arctis is an elusive species, and adults are often seen in low numbers even at places where exuviae are numerous.",

                            "behaviour": "Somatochlora arctica is often found in sunlit edge-zones on open mires where birch and pine from the adjacent forest is sparser. Or on forest roads where they hunt low, in waist height or lower, wile flying back and forth along the roadsides. They can also hunt higher up in the air and you can se tens of individuals hunt together shortly after they left the water. Mating is done low and perching individuals like to sit low, often directly on the ground, in contrast to most other emerald dragonflies. Younger individuals stray into the surrounding forests before they mature and return to the waters. Sometimes indiciduals of S. arctica can be found very far from suitable breeding habitats.\n\nMales fly low and jerky over moss puddles and wet areas on mires where they can be seen fighting short territorial fights with other males. Out in the open areas it can be far between suitable small waters and the males fly back and forth between these. \n\nFemales oviposit in floating Sphagnums or natural watery depressions or such made from footprints beside footpaths. The larvae live in wet Sphagnum moss, often no deeper than 15-30 cm. Larva development normally takes at least 2 years. Exuviae is left directly on or close to wet Sphagnum moss.",
                            "habitat": "Somatochlora arctica favours Sphagnum peat bogs and transitional mires where the larvae are generally found in places with only very small amounts of open water, often around one square meter and sometimes just a few square decimeters. These situations can be found at small depressions and runnels in active peat bogs, abandoned peat diggings and small water holes in marshes, moorlands and tundra. Occasionally there is some barely visible flow of ground or surface water. It is one of the few species that can survive in peat bogs where the vegetation approaches the climax stage. Suitable breeding habitats are nearly always free of fish, often devoid of Amphibians and support a limited amount of other dragonfly species. The key for success for S. arctica seems to be that it is able to occur in marginal habitats and so avoid competition with other species. Adults typically rest in, or hunt near trees, and populations are often found near forests, although populations in largely open landscapes also commonly occur. This specie is found from sea level in the north of its range to 2 000 m in the extreme south of its range, where it is restricted to mountains.",

At this stage they fly at breast height within a limited area and often perches shortly fully exposed. Later they only patrol over water. It flies leisurely for being an emerald and can sometimes be distinguished by only this mode of flight. Mating wheels may circle low over reedbeds for minutes at a time.

Most of its habitats have a reduced surface of open water due to the density and expanse of the vegetation. In many cases, a layer of at least 10 cm organic material is present at the bottom, while the water is generally shallow. Larvae are capable of surviving an absence of free water for a period of a few weeks. Favoured habitats are fish free and largely unshaded., but often near forest. At such sites, adults are mostly found at the periphery of their breeding habitat, often foraging in meadows and sunny spots in, or along, the forest edges.

Further north it is known from mostly isolated populations in Austria and the Czech Republic. The situation in Hungary is unclear as most national Somatochlora records are based on larvae that were not identified to species. Confirmed Somatochlora meridionalis adults have been found in western Hungary, but these records were either unpublished or published under S. metallica. A review of records of S. metallica and S. meridionalis in central Europe is essential to properly understand their respective distributions in this area. It is unclear how far east the species  can be found and future work might show the species to be present in Moldova and southwest Ukraine. In the western Mediterranean, disjunct populations of S. meridionalis are known from central Italy, Corsica and from an area running from north-west Italy to south-east France.",

It can be common in intermittently flowing streams that become fragmented into residual, largely disconnected pools during summer, where the larvae are able to survive the dry season. Adults are mostly seen along shaded stretches of watercourses and the presence of shade on most of the water surface is an important habitat characteristic.

It can be distingushed from many other Somatochloras (except S. alpestris) by its dark, almost black green colour and its white, not yellow, ring between S2 and S3. The white ring is often clearly visible from above. Females can have a second white, thinner and broken, ring on the segment after the first ring. It can appear as slightly more robust than S. alpestris, partly due to even darker color. Even the eyes on the males are often just as dark as the body and does not contrast. Older females can have red-brown eyes. Immature individuals have lighter eye colours.  Eyes have a grey patch on the side, as on S. alpestris and S. arctica, where the other Somatochloras have a yelow-green patch. Pterostigmas are light. Female pterostigma can be almost orange, and can be compared to S. alpestris and S. arcticas darker pterostigma. To be completely sure in identification one must control the male appendages or the female valvula. The male appendages are hairy and abruptly angled.

The species is often referred to as the northernmost dragonfly in the world. Despite its large range, it is rather poorly known and less than eighty sites are currently documented worldwide. Most of these are found around the tree line in the transition area between taiga and tundra. In north America, it extends from Alaska to to north-west Canada. In Eurasia it is found in several apparently disjunct areas, one in the extreme north of Fennoscandia and Russia, another extending from the Altai across the south of Siberia with isolated records in Amurland and a relatively small area of occurrence in Kamtjatka. Siberia is however poorly explored and the presence of populations in the intervening areas, particularly at higher altitudes, cannot be ruled out. \n\nFewer then 30 localities ar known from Europe, all found in the region from the north of Fennoscandia to the north-east of European Russia. All European populations are found in areas with permafrost, near and north of the Arctic Circle, in either the tundra or the northern part of the taiga. To the east those localities are contiguous with those found in the north of central and western Siberia. Most populations of the species are either small, or fluctuate greatly in the number of adults present annually. In large parts of its range the habitats of S. sahlbergi are difficult to access and, as adult activity is largely restricted to sunny periods, poor weather conditions often limit the chances of finding the species on the wing. Most of the regions where S. sahlbergi occurs are poorly surveyed and many populations probably remain to be discovered.",

Somatochlora sahlbergi is rarely seen in greater numbers than a few at a time, more than ten at a time is exceptional. Flying period is short and varies greatly from season to season. Lately it has been established that it usually starts to fly the first or second week in July but it is all over after a few weeks only. At warm weather they are very active and shy. To be able to see the species one should look for it on warm, sunny, wind-setting afternoons. Males are then patrolling over open water, often far from the shore. Foraging is done in sheltered warmer openings in adjacent birch forests. At lower temperatures they are easier to come close but harder to find. They might not lift from perching positions even if disturbed. The species rest directly on the ground but for night it takes place at head-height in some birch adjacent to the water. \n\nFemales oviposit flying or sitting by the water, in shallow water or floating Sphagnum moss. Larvae are found on shallow depth and locally in very shallow running waters. Larvae development is probably between two or four years. Exuviae is left high on strands growing out in water or along shores.",

There should be shelter from wind nearby like groves of Mountain Birch, low hills or palsa and there should be floating Sphagnum moss. At its only locality in Sweden the water is connected to slowly trickling cold springs. The species seem to be confined to areas with long and cold winters and short summers in regions with a moderate amount of summer precipitation. These conditions allow the formation of palsa mires and bogs, ice lenses covered by peat hummocks giving rise to flooded bogs and peaty pools after melting. S. sahlbergi is in Europe largely restricted to such habitats, which ensure permanent cold water throughout the year, although it does not occur over the whole palsa area. In eastern Russia, the species also occur in areas without palsa mires, showing that it is not restricted to this kind of habitat.

The wings have an area suffused with yellow at the base that in females axtends along the margins. The abdomen of the males is expanded at S8. Oxygastra curtisii can be recognisedin flight by its abdomen being arched similarly to Onychogomphus species. It is darker and more slender than Cordulea aenea and Somatochlora metallica, the abdominal club lies closer to the tip (S8 is the widest segment).",

The highest densitiy of populations is found in the south-western Mediterranean parts of France, northern Portugal and western Spain. France harbours over 80% of currently known populations. In central and eastern Spain the species has a scattered distribution, generally being found in low densities. It is not uncommon in northern Italy and adjacent areas of Switzerland. Other Italian populations are mostly found in the western part of the country, a distribution mimicking that of Onychogomphus uncatus. The species occurs locally in the north and north-east of France and only one population remain in Belgium in the Ourthe River. In germany it was found in 1940 to 1943 along the Sieg river in northern Rhein-Westphalia, and a vigorous population has been known since 1997 along the Our river, which forms the border between Germany and Luxembourg. Oxygastra curtisii is extinct from Great Britain and the Netherlands.",

The species favours situations where the water is surrounded by trees situated directly at the waters' edge, where larvae can remain within the extensive submerged root systems. Oxygastra curtisii favours lowlands and hilly regions below 800 m, although it is occasionally found up to 1 000 m in Spain.",
