{"items_id":"63793274e52e88f91ada8b809ef9da1d","scientific_name":"Coenagrion pulchellum","local_names":["Variable damselfly"],"description":"The males of this species are light blue to blue with black markings.\nThey can be confused with the males of C. puella from which they can be distinguished by a general darker colouration,\nthe larger extension of the black markings on the abdomen.\nThe pattern makes the shape af a Y instead of a U on S2 and the antehumeral stripes often being split and thereby\nresembling an exclamation mark.\n\nSometimes the antehumeral stripes are complete but have a narrower neck towards the rear part ot the thorax.\nSometimes the marking on S2 is not connected to the hind margin, making it look like C. puella.\nBut any male with both broken antehumeral stripes and a good Y-shape on S2 should, with certainty, be a C. pulchellum.\n\nThe females have two colour forms, blue or green, like C. puella.\nTheir identification is difficult and can only be done with certainty by looking \nat the shape and hind margin of the pronotum, that being dented in three points, form three lobes.","behaviour":"To find plenty of this species, look at edge zones, like sunny wind-protected glades and like.\nAt really good spots you can find thousands of individuals.","size":{"length":"34-38 mm","wingspan":"32-46 mm"},"similar_species":["Coenagrion sp."],"distribution":"Coenagrion pulchellum is widespreadin central Europe but missing from most of the Iberian Peninsula and northern parts of Fennoscandia.\nIt is rare in parts of mainland Italy and absent from Sicily.\nThe species is reasonably common on Corsica but absent on Sardinia.\nIn the Balkan Peninsula it becomes scarcer towards the south, but reaches the southern Peloponese in Greece.\nIn the Iberian Peninsula the species is rare and scattered in northern Spain.\nOnly one recorded observation is made in Portugal but more small overlooked populations might exist in both Spain and Portugal.","habitat":"Coenagrion pulchellum is found in standing waters and slow-flowing sections of rivers.\nHabitats are largely unshaded oligotrophic, mesotrophic or eutrophic and nearly always have a well-developed bank-side and aquatic\nvegetation.\nFavuored habitats include lakes, ponds, fens, peat bogs, oxbows, ditches and canals.\nThe species is generally absent from fast-flowing waters.\nC. pulchellum is mainly found in lowlands but breeds up to 1 500 m in southern Europe.","flight_period":"April to August-September","red_list":{"habitats_directive":"No","red_list_EU27":"Least Concern","red_list_europe":"Least Concern","red_list_mediterranean":"Near threatened","EU27_endemic":"No","red_list_europe_endemic":"No","trend_europe":"Stable"}}
