  "description": "The **_Euphaeidae_** are a family of damselflies in the order Odonata sometimes called Epallaginidae. They are commonly known as **gossamerwings**. It is a small family of damselflies with around 70 species. They commonly occur in Old World tropics. They are large and mostly metallic-coloured. They look similar to species of damselflies in the family Calopterygidae.\n\nThe larvae have seven pairs of supplementary gills along the abdomen in addition to the usual three sac-like gills at the tip of the abdomen. Adults have fore- and hindwings of equal length, barely petiolate and a long pterostigma that is broader in the hindwing. Adults have close veins and numerous antenodals (15-38), and most breed in forest streams.",
