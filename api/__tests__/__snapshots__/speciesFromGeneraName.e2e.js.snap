The male usually incessantly patrols its territory but it is not uncommon that it alights on 
tall grass and bushes.

It is the only species of Aeshna in which the male stays attached to the female after mating, laying eggs.",

The males have bright blue eyes and facial suture barely marked. 
Thorax is yellow-brown with blue hues in mature males.

In contrast with other species of the family Aeshnidae like A. cyanea and A. viridis, 
antehumeral stripes are short and narrow, 
abdomen is characterised by large light-blue spots and by a distinctive black pattern
on the second abdominal segment, S2.
The pterostigma is relatively long.
The Costa, wing front, has a light colour.

The females can be very similar to males. 
A more lightly yellow jizz compared to other females can be noted.
They can be distinguished from those of A. mixta by the relatively short abdominal appendages.
The rather uni-coloured sides of the abdomen of females make them look a lot like females of A. viridis.  ",

To the North the range reaches southern Sweden and Estonia.
To the east it appears to be fairly common in easter Ukraine and scattered throughout southern European Russia.
In large parts of its distribution it is rare or absent. 
This could be explained by a preference for warmer areas combined with a habitat preference for extensive reed marshes

These can be used to distinguish from A. subarctica whose spots have broader shapes.

Wings are clear with long pterostigmas and yellow leading margin.

Thorax is brown with narrow antehumeral stripes.
Thorax sides have two broad bands, coloured blue, green or yellow. 
Between the band are 1-3 smaller spots.
The shape of them can be used in separating from similar species,

Frons is yellow with a black T-shaped marking. 
This marking distinguishes it from simillar specie A. Serrata whose stem is less distinct.

Eyes have a yellow spot on the backside, which distinguishes it from A. subarctica. 
Variations occur with very small or indistinguishable spots.

The northern can be found from north of Scania, Sweden, and northwards.

In this area, it has proliferated since 2000 and is now increasingly found in other types of habitats
such as small streams.
Many of the micro-habitats where the larvae are found have the following factors in common: the water temperature
can rise quickly in summer and teh dense vegetation, the acidity and/or a low water table
limit predation by other dragonflies or fish.
The species mainly occurs at lower altitudes and is not found above 1000 m.",

Antehumeral stripes either absent or reduced to spots.
Side of the thorax bluish-green.
Lower appendages on the males are particularly long, often as long as the last abdominal segment,

The appendages earned the species its name, armatum is latin for armed.
Females also dark with abdominal segments S1-S3 and S8 partly blue.

In Fennoscandia it is occasionally found in slow-fowing river sections.
Here it occurs among large swathes of sedges, Water horsetail and low reed.
The key factor determining habitat suitability is the vegetation which need to be a rather dense growth of helophytes in shallow water of generally up to half a meter deep.
In order to provide both shelter and space to move, the vegetation should neither be too low nor too high during the flight period.
Suitable conditions can be found in natural and semi-natural habitats such as reed beds and peat excavations in ferns and wet meadows.
In the later types of habitats, the species is dependent on mowing and teh cyclical creation of new peat excavations,
as otherwise its preferred habitats disappear due to the natural regrowth of vegetation.",

identify the species by observing the ventral part of the body that is greenish in males in contrast to the dorsal 
part which is mainly black.
In fact only S8 and S9 are completely light blue, apart from the already mentioned S2.

Females vary greatly in colour, often greenish yellow but not as clearly yellow as C. hastulatum can be.
Abdominal parts mainly dark except a part on S8 which is half blue, half black and 
where the black part has a characteristic frontally pointing thorn-shape 
which distinguishes it from other Coenagrion females.",
        "distribution": "Coenagrion lunulatum has a disjunct distribution in Europe. The core of its range includes the Netherlands, northern Germany,
Poland, the south of both Sweden and Finland, and the Baltic states, from where it is expected to continue east
to the Ural Mountains.
The species is rare south and north of this core region and is mostly found in scattered, small populations
from the Ukrainian Carpathians to the Czech Republic and the Alps, and throughout most of Fennoscandia.
In contrast to its rarity in the Alps, it is well established in Massif Central in France, which constitutes
a dijunct area of occurence. 
Another disjunct area is found in Ireland, where C. lunulatum is widespread but uncommon in the northern half of 
the island.
It is remarkably absent from Great Britain.",

peat bogs and fens.
These often support a vegetation of small sedges and Sphagnum peat mosses, and are largely unshaded.
Most habitats lie within or in direct proximity to forests.
In the east of its range, the species is found in a wider range of habitats such as cattle ponds and gravel and clay pits,
where it occurs regularly in slightly more eutrophic water bodies with rather ordinary fringing vegetation.
C. lunulatum is mainly found in lowlands and low hills in the north of its range, and is confined to mountains up to 1 500 m in the south.
It is very rare in the Alps, which correlates with its rarity in the boreal belt.",

The vegetation near the banks often consists of low herbs and grasses and is frequently used for hay production or grazing.
It is one of the few species that is mainly found in extensive agricultural areas.

Natural habitat types where these conditions occur are spring marshes, karstic springs and streams.
Most of the European populations are presently found in agricultural areas, at small ditches and streams.
MAny of these habitats depend on both the cyclic cleaning of water courses and the mowing of bank side vegetation to prevent the habitat from becoming overgrown.
In Slovenia it was noted that the species readily colonises newly created ditches and streams.
In most Europe the species favours largely open habitats below 600 m.
In the Balkan Peninsula populations have been found up to 900 m, while in Turkey
