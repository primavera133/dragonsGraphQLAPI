  "description": "**_Enallagma_** is a genus of damselflies in the family Coenagrionidae commonly known as **bluets**./n/n### Identification/n*Enallagma* males are typically being blue, distinctively marked with black. Females are usually brown or blue, with torpedo-like markings on S3-7. They have a small but prominent vulvar spine at the base of the ovipositor. /n/n### Separation from other genera/nThe blue-and-black pattern of males recalls most *Coenagrion* species and also *Erythromma lindenii*. Only *Ischnura* females share the vulvar spine, although it is weaker on them. Brown females may be confused with *Sympecma*, which has similar markings on S3-6. However they differ in having long pterostigma and different markings and venation. /n/n### Behaviour /nMales prefer open water, where they fly and perch on floating plants close to the water surface. Otherwise recalls other *Coenagrion* species in behaviour.",
