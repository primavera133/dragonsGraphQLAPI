  "description": "**_Oxygastra_** is a genus of dragonflies. It is taxonomically uncertain and not presently placed in a family. It was showed in 2007 that the only species in the genus, *Oxygastra curtisii* does not belong in the family Corduliidae. It constitutes probably the phylogenetically most isolated species in Europe and is probably its oldes relict. It is not clear in which family it should be placed and is therefore considered *incertae sedis*.",
