Most like Aeshna Serrata but more likely to be \nconfused with A. juncea or A. subarctica which can be found in the same habitats.\n\nMales are intensely blue, with only blue or black markings on the abdomen.\n\nBlue to emerald eyes, with all black back-sides (like A. juncea and A. subarctica). \nThe Costa, wing front, is brown (like A. subarctica).\nBlack markings on the frons T-shaped with a thick stem.\nLateral markings on thorax are wide and clearly visible in flight, in both sexes, and can be used to \ndistinguish from A. juncea and A. subarctica in flight.\n\nOlder females have dark bands on the wings, between the pterostigma and the node, visible also in flight. \nThis is a diagnostic feature, all other similar species have venly coloured wings.","behaviour":"Male can be very aggressive and hunt other Aeshna males from their territory.\nRelatively stationary and is rarely seen outside known habitats.","size":{"length":"70-86 mm","wingspan":"88-120 mm"},"similar_species":["Aeshna juncea","Aeshna subarctica","Aeshna serrata"],"distribution":"In Europe it is only present in southern Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Russia. \nIt's world distribution goes east over Siberia, Kamtjatka, Sachalin, South Korea and Japan.","habitat":"Found in nutrient-poor waters in nothern boreal regions, like smaller lakes and moss tarns.","flight_period":"End of June to mid September, peaking in second half of July and August.","red_list":{"habitats_directive":"No","red_list_EU27":"Near threatened","red_list_europe":"Least Concern","red_list_mediterranean":"Not present","EU27_endemic":"No","red_list_europe_endemic":"No","trend_europe":"Stable"}}
