  "description": "*Calopteryx exul* replaces *C. splendens* in north-west Africa where it may be noted by it's narrow unbanded wings. These wings flash conspicuously in it's rather rapid flight, often skimming the water surface.\n\nIn both sexes the wings are narrower than all other members of this genus, and remain totally clear. The males venation is metallic, producing a light blue flash on each wingbeat. Legs, especailly femora tend to be paler than in other species, and in both sexes are a chocolate brown rather than black, or black with internal yellow sides.",
