Mixta, which it resembles in many ways.\n\nThe males have bright blue eyes and facial suture barely marked. \nThorax is yellow-brown with blue hues in mature males.\n\nIn contrast with other species of the family Aeshnidae like A. cyanea and A. viridis, \nantehumeral stripes are short and narrow, \nabdomen is characterised by large light-blue spots and by a distinctive black pattern\non the second abdominal segment, S2.\nThe pterostigma is relatively long.\nThe Costa, wing front, has a light colour.\n\nThe females can be very similar to males. \nA more lightly yellow jizz compared to other females can be noted.\nThey can be distinguished from those of A. mixta by the relatively short abdominal appendages.\nThe rather uni-coloured sides of the abdomen of females make them look a lot like females of A. viridis.  ","behaviour":"This species is a powerfull flyer and often migrates from the southernmost areas of Europe far up to the north.\n\nThe male usually incessantly patrols its territory but it is not uncommon that it alights on \ntall grass and bushes.\n\nIt is the only species of Aeshna in which the male stays attached to the female after mating, laying eggs.","size":{"length":"57-66 mm.","wingspan":"74-84 mm."},"similar_species":["Aeshna mixta","Aeshna viridis (females)"],"distribution":"A largely western paleatctic speciea, confined to north-west africa, Europe and south-western Asia.s\nIn Europe it is rarely abundant and present mainly in the south-east.\nIt is relatively uncommon in many areas, including lerge parts of the Iberian peninsula, and to a lesser extent, Italy.\nIt is common in much of south-east Europe and locally abundant i Ukraine.","habitat":"It occurs in environments with standing or slow running water with abundant vegetaion along the banks. \nIt also seems to favour waters on the verge of drying out. \nIt is rarely observed in quarries, gravel pits and above 700 m.","flight_period":"May to August"}
