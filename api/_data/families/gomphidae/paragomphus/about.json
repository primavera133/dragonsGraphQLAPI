  "description": "**_Paragomphus_** is a genus of dragonfly in the family Gomphidae. They are commonly known as **Hooktails**.\n\n### Identification\nThese are rather small gomphids. The males have broad flaps on S8-9 and diagnostic appendages. The upper appendages are long, parallel and bent downwards, like hooks. The lower appendages are at most half of the uppers length. *Paragomphus* has no anal loop in the hindwing: there is a straight perpendicular vein running directly to the wing's hind margin from the last thick lengthwise vein in the wing base. \n\n### Separation from other genera\n*Lindenia tetraphylla* is the only other species with broad flaps, but these are on S7-8 and the species is larger, about 70-80mm long. Small and pale *Onychogomphus* species differ in details of markings and their males lack broad flaps and have different appendages. \n\n### Separation of the species\nNumerous species occur in tropical Africa and Asia, but only two reach the Mediterranean. These differ in coloration. \n\n### Behaviour \nOften perches with abdomen raised in obelisk position.",
