  "description": "Closely related to *Ischnura elegans* which it replaces on the Tyrrhenian islands west of the Italian mainland, and on Malta. It is also very like *I. saharensis* structurally.\n\nThe colour of the face, thorax and abdomen is never blue but always green (although a turquoise tinge develops in full maturity). Females of all colour forms may have black markings on S8. Mature females without antehumeral black stripes may be confused with the co-existing *I. pumilio*, but the relative size in pterostigma is discriminatory, that in the forewing is larger in *I. pumilio*",

  "distribution": "*Ischnura genei* is an endemic to the Tuscan archipelago and the Tyrrhenian and Maltese islands, and is common and widespread within its range. It is absent from mainland Europe and replaces *I. elegans* on the above islands, except in Giglio, where both species cohabit. A male and female were caught on the Italian island of Linosa, between the Maltese islands and the Tunisian coast, in 2010. Whether they belonged to a local population breeding in the few man-made water tanks present on the island or were vagrants are unknown.",
  "habitat": "*Ischnura genei* breeds in all kinds of standing waters and sometimes in slow-flowing rivers and ditches up to 1 000 m. This species usually frequents water bodies rich in surrounding vegetation. Like *I. elegans*, it is capable of breeding in waters with relatively high salinities, and larvae have been recorded from brackish waters.",
