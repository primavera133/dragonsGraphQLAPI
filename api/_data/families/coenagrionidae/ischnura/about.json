  "description": "**_Ischnura_** is a genus of damselflies known as **forktails** in the family Coenagrionidae. Forktails are distributed worldwide, including various oceanic islands. The males have a forked projection at the tip of the abdomen which gives the group their common name.\n\n**Identification**\nSmall delicate damselflies. The males are easily recognised by their contrasting blue 'tail-light' marking at the end of the abdomen. The abdomen is otherwise largely black or bronze-black dorsally, with the underside of S3-S& yellow.\n\nMales have a bicoloured pterostigma in the forewing. The inner part is dark grey while the outer part is whitish. At the base of the ovipositor the females usually have a small vulvar spine on the underside of S8.\n\n### Separation from other genera\nThe dark abdomen with blue 'tail-light' may recall dark-bodied *Coenagrion* or *Erythromma* species, but both these have unicoloured dark pterostigmas. In *Coenagrion* S2 is mainly blue, and dark *Erythromma* have conspicuous red eyes. The vulvar spine feature of the *Ischnura* is shared only with Enallagma females, however these differ in their abdominal markings. \n\n#### Behaviour\nFemales of *Ischnura* oviposit alone, unlike other small damselflies who often do thisin tandem. After emergence, many adults remain close to water, often creating high proportions of mating pairs and tenerals at a site. \n",
