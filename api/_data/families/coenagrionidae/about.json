  "description": "The insect family **Coenagrionidae** is placed in the order Odonata and the suborder Zygoptera. The Zygoptera are the damselflies, which although less known than the dragonflies, are no less common. More than 1,300 species are in this family, making it the largest damselfly family. The family Coenagrionidae has six subfamilies: Agriocnemidinae, Argiinae, Coenagrioninae, Ischnurinae, Leptobasinae, and Pseudagrioninae.\n\nThis family is referred to as the **narrow-winged damselflies** or the **pond damselflies**. The Coenagrionidae enjoy a worldwide distribution, and are among the most common of damselfly families. This family has the smallest of damselfly species. More than 110 genera of the family Coenagrionidae are currently accepted.\n\nThe family was named by [William Forsell Kirby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Forsell_Kirby) in 1890. The name may be derived from Greek *coen* meaning shared or common and *agrio* meaning fields or wild.",
