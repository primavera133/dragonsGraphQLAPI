  "description": "**_Stylurus_** is a genus of **clubtail dragonflies** in the family Gomphidae.\n\nThey are commonly known as **_hanging clubtails_** from their habit of hanging nearly vertically when they perch.\n\nMost of the species in the *stylurus* genus is found in North America. Recently *S. flavipes* was moved from *Gomphus* to *Stylurus*. This was after DNA studies had found the specie to be closer related to the other *Stylurus* species.",
