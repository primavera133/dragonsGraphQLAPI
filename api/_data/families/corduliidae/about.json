  "description": "The **_Corduliidae_**, also knowns as the **emeralds**, **emerald dragonflies** or **green-eyed skimmers**, is a family of dragonflies. These dragonflies are usually black or dark brown with areas of metallic green or yellow, and most of them have large, emerald-green eyes. The larvae are black, hairy-looking, and usually semiaquatic. They are not uncommon and are found nearly worldwide. The Treeline Emerald ([*Somatochlora sahlbergi*](https://dragonfly.guide/species/Somatochlora%20sahlbergi/)) belongs to this family and is not (yet) rare but considered extremely hard to see as an adult. It is one of the species most endangered by the global warming.",
