  "description": "Endemic to southern Greece, *Cordulegaster helladica* is black and yellow with green eyes like most other Cordulegaster. Very similar to *C. insignis* but with a different distribution range. Frons is yellow with a reduced or absent black band. The yellow markings on the abdomen are very large, median rings are dorsally connected on S2-S6(7) and it has apical spots on S2-S5. The anal loop of the hind wing is formed by 3 cells. The occipital triangle is usually black. In Greece and south-eastern Europe the identification of the various species of Cordulegaster can only be made with certainty by examining the male terminal appendages.",

  "distribution": "*Cordulegaster helladica* is endemic to Greece. It has three subspecies, and the nominotypical subspecies is by far the most widespread, with its range including the Peloponnese, Euboea island and Attica in the south-east of mainland Greece. *Cordulegaster h. buchholzi* is restricted to the Cyclades Islands of Andros, Tinos and Naxos. *Cordulegaster h. kastalia* is known from the Kastalian spring, a karstic outflow at the Delphi archaeological site, and from another remote locality on the eastern coast of mainland Greece.",
  "habitat": "*Cordulegaster helladica* is known from hilly and mountainous forests or open woodlands with mediterranean scrub, and occurs up to 1 400 m. It inhabits the upper reaches of rocky and boulder streams. As usual in Mediterranean streams, these habitats often show strong fluctuations in flow rates.",
