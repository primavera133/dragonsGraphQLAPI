{"items_id":"6ee2f4a1673f5a4dc900ccfbd6a0e82e","scientific_name":"Erythromma lindenii","local_names":["Goblet-marked damselfly"],"description":"Closely related to E. najas and E. viridulum but does not resemble them much, apart from in behaviours.\nVery simillar to Enallagma cyathigerum and has the same wide antehumeral stripes, however \nit has the, typically for Coenagrions, black marking along the interpleural suture on the side of the thorax and this combination is diagnostic.\n\nThis species can also be distinguished from the rest of the Coenagrionidae thanks to the light-coloured post-ocular \nspots that are linear instead of round, often connected together, forming a line across the back of the head.\nThe males have blue eyes in contrast to a black head. \nEyes darker shade of blue than the rest of the body.\nThe abdomen is blue with black markings. \nThe second segment, S2, has a characteristic marking in the shape of a 'goblet' or the 'hilt of a sword'.\nS3-S6 have distinctive markings, in the shape of 'spear-heads'.\nS7 and particularly S8 are black instead of light blue.\nThe last two segments, S9-S10, are light blue.\n\nFemales are tricoloured, with background colour from yellowish brown to greenish, \nmiddle part of the abdomen blue.\nThe anal appendages are light in colour.\nThe abdomen is crossed dorsally by a black longitudinal line.\n\nTeneral individuals resemble the other Erythromma sp, who area also coloured in yellow, black and blue; especailly E. viridulum.\nE. lindenii however, has wider antehumeral stripes than E. viridulum and E. najas usually lack them altogether.\nAlso E. najas and E. viridulum lack post-ocular spots.","behaviour":"Behaves a lot like Enallagma cyathigerum and likes to perch on floating vegetation like water lilies and pondweeds.","size":{"length":"30-36 mm","wingspan":"40-45 mm"},"similar_species":["Enallagma cyathigerum","Coenagrion sp.","Erythromma najas","Erythromma viridulum"],"distribution":"Erythromma lindenii is widespread and common on the Iberian Peninsula, Italy, France and parts of Germany.\nFurther north it, becomes scarcer, having its northern limit in the Netherlands and northern Germany.\nThe species had for a long time an isolated occurence in mid-eastern Germany, western Poland and northern parts of the Czech Republic.\nDue to its recent expansion in Germany the gap between the central European enclave and other European populations is growing \nsmaller and might completely disappear in the near future.\n\nThe species is largely confined to lower elevations and to the Mediterranean fringes, extending along the Black Sea coast as far as the Crimean Peninsulaand reaching the south of European Russia.\n\nNorthwards, the species has increased its range with nearly 200 km from the 1990s onwards.\nThis expansion has been noted in Belgium, the Netherlands and northern Germany ad was most likely caused by increasing temperatures during recent decades.\nIt is unclear if the increase in records from south-east Europe also represents an expansion or is the result of changes in the available habitats or increased fieldwork.","habitat":"Erythromma lindenii is found in running waters including large streams, connected oxboxs, rivers, canals and \nlarger standing waters such as lakes, (fish)ponds, gravel pits.\nBreeding habitats are generally large, largely unshaded with clear oxygenated water.\nThe species is less common on fast-flowing waters, and in streams and rivers with a strong current it is \noften confined to areas where the flow is the weakest.\nIn most cases there is a rich submerged aquatic vegetation with helophyte belts poorly developed or even absent.\nIn fish-free waters, the presence of aquatic vegetation is of less importance, suggesting that \nthe latter is mainly important in providing shelter against predation.\nStanding waters where the species occurs are often influenced by wind, which generates waves, or are fed by seepage,\nboth which help to oxygenate the water and break down stratification.\nThis produces conditions resembling to those found in running waters.\nThroughout its range, the species is confined to lower altitudes and most of the records are from below 500 m.","flight_period":"May to October","red_list":{"habitats_directive":"No","red_list_EU27":"Least Concern","red_list_europe":"Least Concern","red_list_mediterranean":"Least Concern","EU27_endemic":"No","red_list_europe_endemic":"No","trend_europe":"Increasing"}}
