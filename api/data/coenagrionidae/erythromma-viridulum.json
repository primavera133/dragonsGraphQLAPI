{"items_id":"04a8b550c6086dedf6e667d060529147","scientific_name":"Erythromma viridulum","local_names":["Small red-eyed damselfly"],"description":"Males have red eyes, mainly black bodies with sides of the thorax and the last segments on the abdomen light blue.\nFemales green and black, with brown eyes.\nIt could be confused with E. najas but can be distinguished by smaller size, more slender build, \nantehumeral stripes complete in females and complete or reduced in the males, \nand by the different extension of the light blue colour on the ventral side of S2-S3 and S8 in the males that also \nhave a distictive black marking in the shape of an X on the last abdominal segment, S10.\naLso the males have S8 partly blue, rather than completely black in E. najas.","behaviour":"Much like Erythromma najas it likes to perch on floating vegetation. ","size":{"length":"25-35 mm","wingspan":"30-42 mm"},"similar_species":["Erythromma najas","Erythromma lindenii"],"distribution":"The main European range lies in the south and west Europe where the species is common and widespread.\nAn expanson of its range has taken place since the 1970s and has gained some 100-500 km northwards since the 1980s.\nIt was recorded as new to Great Brittain (1999), Denmark (2001), Sweden (2004), Belarus (2005) Lithuania (2007) and Latvia (2008).\nPrior to 1970s it was rare in the Netherlands, but presently the second most common damselfly.\nThis range expansion might be linked with increased temperatures, but the species might also have benefited from \nnitrogen enrichment of aquatic habitats by areial deposition.\nThe species has a scattered occurence in parts of the Balkan Peninsula and Ukraine and relatively few records are known from \nEuropean Russia, probably due to poor sampling.","habitat":"Erythromma viridulum if found in largely unshaded, standing or slow-flowing waters with aquatic vegetation, \nincluding brackish waters.\nIt often co-occurs with E. najas at habitats with large floating leaves.\nIn contrast to this species, however, it is especially common at waters with rich, fine-leaved,\naquatic vegetation such as waterweed, hornworth, watermillfoil and mats of algae on the water surface.","flight_period":"May to September","red_list":{"habitats_directive":"No","red_list_EU27":"Least Concern","red_list_europe":"Least Concern","red_list_mediterranean":"Least Concern","EU27_endemic":"No","red_list_europe_endemic":"No","trend_europe":"Increasing"}}
